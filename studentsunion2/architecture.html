                                            <p>The Graves Building was donated to the students of the university as a personal gift by J G Graves, a local mail-order businessman and city benefactor. It was designed by the Professor of Architecture, Stephen Welsh. The new building was opened in 1936. The interesting fact is that it was designed to separate men from women, but this didn’t last long.</p>

The lower floors of University House were altered and the Link Building was extended.</p>
