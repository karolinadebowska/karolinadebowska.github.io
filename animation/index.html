		Hi, my name is Oskar! As you may notice, I'm going through a really tough period in my life. I twisted my left ankle a couple days ago. It's hard to say, but I need your help.
		<br>
		You can feed me (just touch me). If you really do care about my mental condition, you can call my mate, (click behind me). I would really appreciate that. 
		<br>
		I also can do something for you. If you need someone to talk to, just press 'Look at me' button and I will be the best listener. I promise I won't interrupt. I will be just looking at you.
		<br>
		If you are afraid that someone might come and interrupt our special moment, don't worry, I will make sure that we are alone and nobody is nearby. If you press the right button ('Is there anyone else here?'), I will look behind me to check it out.
		<br>
		However, I will understand if you prefer to be alone. If you press 'go away' button, I will go away. You can also make me angry and if you click in front of me, I will kick with the right leg.
